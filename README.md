### Posting messages
Users can publish messages to a personal timeline using the command:

    edgar -> I'll have to check out the new album!
    ```

### Viewing a user's timeline
A user's timeline stores all messages posted by that user. Any user can view any other user's timeline simply by entering the username:

```bash
<edgar>
// Wow, amazing gig last night!
// I'll have to check out the new album!
```
